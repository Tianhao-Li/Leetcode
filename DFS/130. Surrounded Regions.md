# 130. Surrounded Regions

## Tag

## Description 

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, *capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by* `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.



## Solution

> Reverse the problem + DFS

- One optimization approach is to start from targets on the boaders and mark them as third class
  1. Less DFS when board size goes up
  2. Convert to the "<u>Number of Islands</u>" problem

```java
class Solution {
    static int m, n;
    static final int[][] dirs = {{-1,0}, {1,0}, {0, -1}, {0,1}};
    
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        m = board.length;
        n = board[0].length;
        // corner case
        if (m <= 2 || n <= 2) {
            return;
        }
        // Search 'O' on the edge, floodfill adjacent 'O'
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // if 'O' on the edge
                if ((i == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1) && board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    dfs(board, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        // Scan the board and change to final state
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j< n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } else if (board[i][j] == '*') {
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Floodfill adjacent 'O' and mark them as a "to-change-back" state
    private void dfs(char[][] board, int x, int y) {
        // Base case: we hit a modified spot or a 'X'
        if (board[x][y] == 'X' || board[x][y] == '*') {
            return;
        }
        // at cur node, modify this 'O'
        board[x][y] = '*';
        // Recursive call: reach out to surroundings
        for (int[] dir : dirs) {
            int newX = x + dir[0];
            int newY = y + dir[1];
            if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
                dfs(board, newX, newY);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
