## Description 

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return *the node at which the two lists intersect*. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.



**Example 3:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
- The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
- `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `0 <= skipA < m`
- `0 <= skipB < n`
- `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
- `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.



**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?



## Solution

> Two Pointers + small trick

- The biggest problem is to make sure these 2 pointers reach the intersection starting point at the same time, which is solved by traversing both lists

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        // Two pointers for A & B, but traverse the opposite List first
        ListNode pB = headA, pA = headB;
        while (pA != pB) {
            if (pA == null) {
                pA = headA;
            } else {
                pA = pA.next;
            }
            if (pB == null) {
                pB = headB;
            } else {
                pB = pB.next;
            }
        }
        return pA;
    }
}
```

- **TC: O(m + n)**

- **SC: O(1)**
