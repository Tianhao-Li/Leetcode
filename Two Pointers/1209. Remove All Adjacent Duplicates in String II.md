# 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

## Tag

- String, Stack, Two Pointer
- Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs

## Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal** consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return *the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made*. It is guaranteed that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `2 <= k <= 104`
- `s` only contains lowercase English letters.



## Solution

> Two pointers for copying elements & marking range + Stack for tracking the count

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s, int k) {
        // Idea: Two pointers for copying elements, Stack for tracking the count
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        char[] array = s.toCharArray();
        int slow = 0;

        for (int fast = 0; fast < array.length; slow++, fast++) {
            array[slow] = array[fast];
            if (slow == 0 || array[slow] != array[slow - 1]) {
                // Encounter a different char
                stack.offerFirst(1);
            } else {
                // We have another same char
                int newCount = stack.pollFirst() + 1; // (already pop from stack)
                if (newCount == k) {
                    // If reach k numbers, need to remove them
                    slow -= k;
                } else {
                    // Does not reach k numbers, increment count in stack
                    stack.offerFirst(newCount);
                }
            }
        }

        return new String(array, 0, slow);
    }
}
```
