## Description 

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` *if* `n` *is a happy number, and* `false` *if not*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`



## Solution

> Floyd's Circle-Finding Algorithm

- The essence is to continuously find next number given the rule, then decide whether we could reach 1 or enter a endless loop, which at is core is **<u>deciding whether there's a circle</u>**.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        // Circle-finding algorithm
        // Corner case
        if (n == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        // Two pointers
        int slow = n;
        int fast = n;
        do {
            slow = getNext(slow);
            fast = getNext(getNext(fast));
        } while (fast != 1 && slow != fast);
        // After loop, check whether fast reaches 1 or seen circle
        return fast == 1;
    }
    
    private int getNext(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int cur = n % 10;
            result += cur * cur;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

- **TC: O(log n)**
  - The TC here is **NOT** O(n). Because notice that here `n` is not the number of nodes in the imaginary graph.
  - The TC of getNext(n) is logN (proven by inequities) because the num of digits of n is given by ***log n***. If there's no circle, the time it takes for fast to reach 1 is *O(log n)* (and the TC for first number n is log n, then for numbers after that, they decay by log each time)
  - Otherwise:
    - we're treating the length of the chain to the cycle as insignificant compared to the cost of calculating the next value for the first n
    - After constant time, two pointers both enter the circle, then it also takes constant time for them to meet
    - So the TC is still dominated by calculating the next value for the starting n.

- **SC: O(1)**
