## Description 

Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return *the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party*. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/g2.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- `graph[i][i] == 1`

 

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?



## Solution

- This is similar to **Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm**.

- The idea is to use <u>Linear scan</u> to keep a possible candidate for the celebrity and eliminate not possible people.

- The candidate we get at last is only a possible candidate, we need to validate it



```java
/* The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
      boolean knows(int a, int b); */

public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        // n >= 2, no need to check corner case
        // Init the Celebrity candidate
        int candidate = 0;
        // Loop the other person
        for (int other = 1; other < n; other++) {
            // Case 1: the other person doesn't know candidate
            //         candidate could be final result
            if (knows(other, candidate) && !knows(candidate, other)) {
                continue;
            } else { // Case 2: candidate can not be valid
                candidate = other;
            }
        }
        // Verify the candidate is truly valid
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Skip himself
            if (i == candidate) {
                continue;
            }
            if (!knows(i, candidate) || knows(candidate, i)) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return candidate;
    }
}
```



**TC: O(n)**

**SC: O(1)**



### Follow up

- There are actually some repeated computation of whether A knows B. he lower the number of the celebrity candidate, the more of these duplicated calls there will be, because the celebrity candidate spent longer in the `celebrityCandidate` variable, and so was involved in a lot more of the initial "questioning"
- The calls to `knows(...)` could be expensive, although the best TC would be **O(n)**, we could optimize this solution by storing the "knows" relationships in a **HashMap**.
