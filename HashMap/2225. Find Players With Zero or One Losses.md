# 2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses

## Tag

- HashMap
- Palantir

## Description

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that the player `winneri` defeated player `loseri` in a match.

Return *a list* `answer` *of size* `2` *where:*

- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

**Note:**

- You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
- The testcases will be generated such that **no** two matches will have the **same** outcome.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= matches.length <= 105`
- `matches[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105`
- `winneri != loseri`
- All `matches[i]` are **unique**.



## Solution

> A count map of each player's number of loses

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findWinners(int[][] matches) {
        // Idea: construct a count map of loses of each player
        Map<Integer, Integer> lossesCount = new HashMap<>();

        for (int[] match : matches) {
            int winner = match[0], loser = match[1];
            lossesCount.put(winner, lossesCount.getOrDefault(winner, 0));
            lossesCount.put(loser, lossesCount.getOrDefault(loser, 0) + 1);
        }

        List<List<Integer>> answer =
            Arrays.asList(new ArrayList<>(), new ArrayList<>());
        
        for (Integer player : lossesCount.keySet())
            if (lossesCount.get(player) == 0) {
                answer.get(0).add(player);
            } else if (lossesCount.get(player) == 1) {
                answer.get(1).add(player);
            }

        Collections.sort(answer.get(0));
        Collections.sort(answer.get(1));

        return answer;
    }
}
```
