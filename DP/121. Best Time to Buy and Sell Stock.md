## Tag

## Description 

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`



## Solution

> One pass, maintain min price & max profit

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // Idea: maintain a up-to-date global min price, then compare and update the global max profit
        int globalMin = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            globalMin = Math.min(globalMin, prices[i]);
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - globalMin);
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```
