## Tag

## Description 

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`



## Solution

> 3d DP, optimized

- **<u>States</u>**: day, max transactions, have stock or not
- **<u>Operations</u>**: buy / sell

- Here we consider a new transaction is formed when we buy stock

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // Idea: now we have 4 states for each day, transaction numbers limit k, cur state at hand -- 0/1
        // when we buy a stock, we view it as the transaction number changes
        int n = prices.length;
        int state_1_0 = 0;
        int state_1_1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int state_2_0 = 0;
        int state_2_1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int price = prices[i];
            // k decreases
            state_2_0 = Math.max(state_2_0, state_2_1 + price);
            state_2_1 = Math.max(state_2_1, state_1_0 - price);
            state_1_0 = Math.max(state_1_0, state_1_1 + price);
            state_1_1 = Math.max(state_1_1, -price);
        }

        return state_2_0;
    }
}
```
