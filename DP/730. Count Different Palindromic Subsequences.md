# 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences

## Tag

## Description 

Given a string s, return *the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in* `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `a1, a2, ...` and `b1, b2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `ai != bi`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bccb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba"
Output: 104860361
Explanation: There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 109 + 7.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, or `'d'`



## Solution

> 2D Dynamic Programming

- The first key point is to build the DP transition equation, decided by whether the two ends of substring we consider are the same
- The cases for when left end == right end are complicated

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPalindromicSubsequences(String s) {
        // Idea: DP, use a memo matrix, fill in from diagonal to the corner
        int n = s.length();
        // Corner case
        if (n == 2) {
            return 2;
        }
        
        int[][] memo = new int[n][n]; // memo[i][j]: num of palindromes between index i char and index j char in s

        for (int offset = 0; offset < n; offset++) {
            for (int row = 0; row < n; row++) {
                if (row + offset >= n) {
                    break;
                }

                int i = row;
                int j = row + offset;
                // Diagonal
                if (offset == 0) {
                    memo[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    // Non-diagonal
                    if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) {
                        // 1. char at i != char at j
                        memo[i][j] = memo[i + 1][j] + memo[i][j - 1] - memo[i + 1][j - 1];
                    } else {
                        // 2. char at i == char at j, we need to know how many same chars are inside(even or only 1)
                        // left & right: boundary of range to consider
                        int left = i + 1;
                        int right = j - 1;
                        // Move boundary to find next same char
                        while (left <= right && s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(i)) {
                            left++;
                        }

                            // first term is that every palindrome inside could form another one with i&j
                            // minus is cuz stuff inside [left + 1, right - 1] form same thing with left&right and i&j
                        } else if (left == right) {
                            // Case 2: only 1 same char
                            memo[i][j] = memo[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 1;
                            // +1 is that one from char i or char j, plus the inside same char
