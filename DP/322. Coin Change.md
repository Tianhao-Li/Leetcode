# 322. Coin Change

## Description 

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`



## Solution

> DP (bottom up)

- This is a DP problem, we can solve it by calculating the min # of coins starting from the fewest amount all the way to our target amount
- For each value we consider, we look at each valid coin (value <= this amount), see if memo[amount - value] + 1 (plus 1 of this coin) is a new min

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        // Corner case
        if (amount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int[] memo = new int[amount + 1]; // 0, 1,..., amount; memo[i]: min # of coins needed for amount i
        // Fill the memo with more than max amount(which correspond to consists of all 1)
        Arrays.fill(memo, amount + 1); 
        memo[0] = 0;
        // Compute memo[] from fewest amount
        for (int cur = 1; cur <= amount; cur++) {
            // Check each coin
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
                if (coins[j] <= cur) {
                    memo[cur] = Math.min(memo[cur], memo[cur - coins[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Remember to check whether we have a valid combination
        return memo[amount] > amount ? -1 : memo[amount];
    }
}
```

- **TC: O(amount * num of coins) = O(S * n)**
- **SC: O(S)**
