# 1328. Break a Palindrome

## Tag

- String, Greedy
- Goldman Sachs

## Description 

Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters `palindrome`, replace **exactly one** character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is **not** a palindrome and that it is the **lexicographically smallest** one possible.

Return *the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an **empty string**.*

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `"abcc"` is lexicographically smaller than `"abcd"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `'c'` is smaller than `'d'`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: palindrome = "abccba"
Output: "aaccba"
Explanation: There are many ways to make "abccba" not a palindrome, such as "zbccba", "aaccba", and "abacba".
Of all the ways, "aaccba" is the lexicographically smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: palindrome = "a"
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no way to replace a single character to make "a" not a palindrome, so return an empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= palindrome.length <= 1000`
- `palindrome` consists of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution

> Greedy finding + corner case

- Just greedily find the first non 'a' char in the < length/2 part, change to a
- If all 'a' in the < length/2 part, change the last char to 'b'

```java
class Solution {
    public String breakPalindrome(String palindrome) {
        // High level: greedy change the char starting from 1st position
        int n = palindrome.length();
        // Corner case
        if (n == 1) {
            return "";
        }

        char[] array = palindrome.toCharArray();
        
        // Case 1: Find the first non-a char in < n/2 part, change to a
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n / 2) {
            if (array[i] != 'a') {
                array[i] = 'a';
                return new String(array);
            }
            i++;
        }
        // Case 2: If all < n/2 part are a, change the last char to b
        array[n - 1] = 'b';
        return new String(array);
    }
}
```
