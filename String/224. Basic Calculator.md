## Description 

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return *the result of the evaluation*.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
- `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
- `s` represents a valid expression.
- `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1"` and `"+(2 + 3)"` is invalid).
- `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1"` and `"-(2 + 3)"` is valid).
- There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
- Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.



## Solution

> Recursion for () + Transform +/- to the sign of operand to add

- The `()` could also be solved using a stack

```java
class Solution {
    int i;

    public int calculate(String s) {
        // Idea: Use recursion to handle ()
        int result = 0;
        int operand = 0;
        int sign = 1;

        while (i < s.length()) {
            char c = s.charAt(i++);
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                operand = operand * 10 + (c - '0');
            } else if (c == ' ') {
                continue;
            } else if (c == '(') {
                operand = calculate(s);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                break;
            } else {
                // We encounter '+' or '-', calculate a result
                result += operand * sign;
                sign = c == '+' ? 1 : -1;
                operand = 0;
            }
        }

        // Also need to process the last number
        return result + operand * sign; // just result?
    }
}
```



- **TC: O(N)** -- the operation is essentially a linear scan of s
- **SC: O(N)** -- depth of the call stack
