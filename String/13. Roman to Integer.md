## Description 

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.



## Solution

> Right to left with certain update rule

- The key to solving this problem is to determine the add / deduct rule given the relationship between 2 adjacent characters.

```java
class Solution {
    // Create a dictionary between Roman and Integer
    static Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    // Init
    static {
        map.put('I', 1);
        map.put('V', 5);
        map.put('X', 10);
        map.put('L', 50);
        map.put('C', 100);
        map.put('D', 500);
        map.put('M', 1000);
    }
    
    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        // Init an integer result
        int result = 0;
        // From right to left
        int i = s.length() - 1;
        while (i >= 0) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            // Peek the char on ch's left. If no left, directly add to result
            if (i > 0) {
                char prev = s.charAt(i - 1);
                // Case 1: left num smaller
                if (map.get(prev) < map.get(ch)) {
                    result += (map.get(ch) - map.get(prev));
                    i -= 2;
                } else {
                    // Case 2: left num equal or larger
                    result += map.get(ch);
                    i--;
                }
            } else {
                result += map.get(ch);
                i--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
