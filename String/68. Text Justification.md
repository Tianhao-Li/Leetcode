# 68. Text Justification

## Description 

Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
- The input array `words` contains at least one word.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 300`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
- `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`
- `words[i].length <= maxWidth`



## Solution

> Find range then pad given the rules

- Inside the `findRight()` function, I forgot to ==<u>update "right" index</u>== at first

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> fullJustify(String[] words, int maxWidth) {
        // Idea: Given the words array, each line go as far as possible, then justify this line
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int left = 0;

        // Process one line at a time
        while (left < words.length) {
            // each line go as far as possible
            int right = findRight(words, left, maxWidth);
            // then justify this line
            result.add(justify(words, left, right, maxWidth));
            // move on to next round
            left = right + 1;
        }

        return result;
    }

    // Helper function for finding the rightmost word in this line
    private int findRight(String[] words, int left, int maxWidth) {
        // Start from the word -- words[left]
        int right = left;
        int sumLength = words[right++].length();

        // Expand as far as possible (until invalid)
        // each time "right" is already pointing at the words we have not examined yet
        while (right < words.length && sumLength + 1 + words[right].length() <= maxWidth) { // 1 for space
            sumLength += 1 + words[right].length();
            right++;
        }

        return right - 1; // (Since final invalid right is included)
    }

    // Helper function for justifying this line
    private String justify(String[] words, int left, int right, int maxWidth) {
        // Case 1: only one word included
        if (left == right) {
            return pad(words[left], maxWidth);
        }

        // Case 2: multiple words in this line
        boolean lastLine = (right == words.length - 1); // process differently based on this
        int totalSpace = maxWidth - wordsLength(words, left, right); // the total space to pad
        int numSpace = right - left; // the number of spaces between given words
        // Calculate the space to pad
        String padUnit = lastLine ? " " : " ".repeat(totalSpace / numSpace); // spaces pad at end of each word
        int remainder = lastLine ? 0 : totalSpace % numSpace; // extra space at the end of words on the left
        // Construct the justified version of current line
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            sb.append(words[i]).append(padUnit).append(remainder-- > 0 ? " " : "");
            // last append is for evenly add space to words on the left
        }
        // trim the extra "padUnit" at the end of last word
        String justified = sb.toString().trim();

        return pad(justified, maxWidth); // for the last line with multiple words, still need padding
    }

    // Helper funtion for padding space on the right
    private String pad(String s, int maxWidth) {
        return s + " ".repeat(maxWidth - s.length());
    }

    // Helper function for calculating the total length of give words
    private int wordsLength(String[] words, int left, int right) {
        int totalLength = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            totalLength += words[i].length();
        }

        return totalLength;
    }
}
```



`n` is the number of words

- **TC: O(n)** -- findRight and justify both take O(n)
- **SC: O(1)** -- O(maxWidth)
