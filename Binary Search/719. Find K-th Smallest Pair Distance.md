## Description 

The **distance of a pair** of integers `a` and `b` is defined as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` *smallest **distance among all the pairs*** `nums[i]` *and* `nums[j]` *where* `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,6,1], k = 3
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `2 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`
- `1 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2`



## Solution

> Binary Search + Two Pointers -- "trial and error"

- The main idea is to use Binary Search to find possible solution (i.e. the target difference), then validate whether this is a valid solution
- The way to validate a difference value is to count how many pairs in the array have a difference <= this value, the count number we are looking for should be the 1st occur of a difference where the # of pairs that has difference <= this value is >= k



```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestDistancePair(int[] nums, int k) {
        // 1. Sort the array, TC: O(n logn), SC: O(log n)
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // The boundaries of differece range
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];
        // 2. Binary Search to find the 1st occurrence of a difference 
        //    where the # of pairs that has difference <= this value is >= k
        while (low < high) {
            // "mid" is our guess of the kth smallest distance [cur possible solution]
            int mid = (low + high) / 2; // given the num range, no overflow
            int midCount = getCount(nums, mid);
            // Update Binary Search range
            if (midCount >= k) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
    
  	// Return the # of pairs that have difference <= target
    private int getCount(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        // Use two pointers to count
        // loop the right boundary
        for (int left = 0, right = 0; left < n; ++left) {
            // move left boundary until the distance of this window >= mid
            while (right < n && nums[right] - nums[left] <= target) {
                right++;
            }
            // now (right - left) gives the # of pairs which satisfy that the distance <= mid
            // with this "left" as left boundary
            count += right - left - 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

- **TC: O(n*log n + N * log maxRange)** -- sorting +  getCount * BS

- **SC: O(1)**
