# 285. Inorder Successor in BST

## Tag

- Tree, DFS
- Microsoft, Google, Adobe

## Description 

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return *the in-order successor of that node in the BST*. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- All Nodes will have unique values.



## Solution

> Using BST property

- This problem is just "Finding the smallest number larger than target is BST"



```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        // We want to find the smallest number larger than p.val
        int target = p.val;
        TreeNode prev = null;
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val <= target) {
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                prev = root;
                root = root.left;
            }
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```
