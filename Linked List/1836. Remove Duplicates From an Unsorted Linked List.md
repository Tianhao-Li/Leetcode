# 1836. Remove Duplicates From an Unsorted Linked List

## Tag

- LinkedList
- Goldman Sachs

## Description 

Given the `head` of a linked list, find all the values that appear **more than once** in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values.

Return *the linked list after the deletions.*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted. After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list-1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: 2 and 1 both appear twice. All the elements should be deleted.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list-2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [3,2,2,1,3,2,4]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: 3 appears twice and 2 appears three times. After deleting all 3's and 2's, we are left with [1,4].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`



## Solution

> First pass find duplicate + Second pass construct list

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicatesUnsorted(ListNode head) {
        // Idea: use a set to store seen values, then pass again to construct the list
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);

        // 1. First pass, find duplicate
        ListNode cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            if (!set.contains(cur.val) && !set.contains(-cur.val)) {
                // 1. haven't seen it before
                set.add(cur.val);
            } else if (set.contains(cur.val)) {
                // 2. now we see duplicate
                set.remove(cur.val);
                set.add(-cur.val);
            }
            // Move to next node
            cur = cur.next;
        }

        // 2. Second pass, constuct the linked list
        ListNode newHead = dummy;
        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head.val)) {
                newHead.next = head;
                newHead = newHead.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }

        // Cut the tail after the last element we want
        newHead.next = null;

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```



- Below is a better runtime complexity solution

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicatesUnsorted(ListNode head) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> repeatedNodes = new HashMap<>();
        ListNode tempHead = new ListNode(); // temporary node as a temp head in case the head is one of the nodes needs to be deleted or head is null
        tempHead.next = head; // set temporary node next to head
        ListNode curr = tempHead.next;
        while(curr!=null) {
            repeatedNodes.put(curr.val, repeatedNodes.getOrDefault(curr.val, 0)+1); // count the repeated node values
            curr=curr.next;
        }

        ListNode prev = tempHead; // set the previous node (parent node) to temporary head
        curr = tempHead.next;
        while(curr !=null) {
            // if current node value is bigger than 1, it needs to be deleted
            if(repeatedNodes.get(curr.val)>1) { 
                prev.next = curr.next; // set previous node next to curr.next instead of curr. As curr node needs to be deleted
                curr.next = null; // set curr next to null as we need to remove curr from the list, so need to set it's pointer to null
                curr = prev; // make sure we set current node to previous node as current node has been already removed from the list
            }
            prev=curr;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        return tempHead.next; // we should return tempHead.next but not tempHead as tempHead is a dummy node we created
    }
}
```
